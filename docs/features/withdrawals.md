## Withdrawal Limits

### No Platform Limits

**StackSave does NOT impose**:
- ❌ No minimum withdrawal
- ❌ No maximum withdrawal
- ❌ No daily limits
- ❌ No withdrawal fees
- ❌ No lock-up periods

### Network Considerations

**Be aware of**:
- ✅ Gas fees apply (blockchain network)
- ✅ Network congestion may delay
- ✅ Minimum may not be economical due to gas

**Example**:
```
Withdraw $10 USDC
Gas Fee: $5 USDC

❌ Not recommended
Gas is 50% of withdrawal!

Better: Withdraw larger amount
```

---

## Gas Fees

### Understanding Gas

Gas fees are paid to blockchain network, not to StackSave:

**Fee Components**:
```
Gas Fee Breakdown:

Base Fee:         15 Gwei
Priority Fee:     2 Gwei
Gas Limit:        65,000

Total: ~$2.50 USD
```

### Optimizing Gas

**Save on Gas Fees**:

1. **Withdraw During Off-Peak**:
   - Evenings (UTC)
   - Weekends
   - Avoid major events

2. **Check Gas Prices**:
   - Use gas trackers
   - Wait for lower prices
   - Set custom gas limit

3. **Batch Withdrawals**:
   - Withdraw from multiple goals → combine if possible
   - Larger amounts = better fee ratio

4. **Choose Right Speed**:
```
Transaction Speed:

● Slow (10-30 min)     $1.50
○ Standard (3-5 min)   $2.50
○ Fast (30-60 sec)     $4.00

```

### Handling Failed Withdrawals
