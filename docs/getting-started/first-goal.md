## Tips for Success

### 🎯 Start Small
Your first goal doesn't need to be huge. Start with something achievable to build confidence.

### 📅 Set Realistic Deadlines
Give yourself enough time. Too ambitious deadlines can be demotivating.

### 💡 Be Specific
"Vacation to Japan" is more motivating than just "Travel".

### 🔄 Regular Deposits
Small, regular deposits often work better than large, infrequent ones.

### 📊 Check Progress Often
Seeing progress is motivating. Check your goals regularly.

### 🎉 Celebrate Milestones
When you hit 25%, 50%, 75% - celebrate! You're making progress.
